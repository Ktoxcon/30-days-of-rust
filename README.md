# 40 Days Of Rust ðŸ¦€

## What's this repository?

This repository is meant to be some kind of a blog on my journey of learning the **Rust** programming language.

For 40 days I will add a new piece of code that implements some feature of the **Rust** programming language, I will basically  
compose all the things, so on day 40 I'm supposed to push a complex application or at least some useful software that  
demonstrates that I am decent applying the concepts I learned.

## Why Rust?

**TLDR**  
Why not? It is a really good, challenging language and if you want to do this challenge too, I know you will have a lot of fun and  
more importantly you will learn a lot of new things. If you want to know my motivations keep reading.

To be honest, **Rust** wasn't my first choice when I first thought of doing this, not because I didn't like it, but because I didn't know  
 it existed in the first place.

**Rust** caught my eye when I read a really good programmer's blog (can't remember his name) about web assembly.  
As a software engineer, I've already heard about Web Assembly and the really cool features and performance improvements  
that come with using it, but I've never really delved into the subject.

In his blog post, this guy explained how to implement
Web Assembly making use of **Rust** and it was at that  
moment that I fell in love with this new language, I did not understand anything about
the tutorial ðŸ˜… but it feels like a good  
uncertainty.

So in summary I decided to undertake this new adventure because I believe that it'll not be something easy and therefore  
the benefit that I'll obtain in the end will be more than just having learned a new programming language, it will be to have  
advanced in many new aspects of my career and skills.

## Why 40 days?

I know there are many similar challenges, like 100 days of this or 60 days of that, but I choose 40 days because  
sometimes I'm lazy and wanted a more realistic challenge. Before starting 100 days of something that in the end I know I'll  
never complete.

I believe in the power of being honest with yourself and in the fact that it's better to do something small but beautiful than  
to try to do something big that will be nothing in the end.

The last reason why I chose 40 days, is because in some way this will serve as reflection and therapy for me (this project is  
strongly inspired by Serenity OS) and you know, if even Jesus took 40 days in the desert why not 40 days of Rust ðŸ¦€?
