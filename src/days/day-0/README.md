# Day 0

On day #0 I only added a well known hello world example, this is very common in the learning journey  
of all programming languages.

## Notes

It's really interesting how **Rust** doesn't need any specific import statement or extra library to print some text in `stdio`.  
In **Rust** `println!` is a macro not a function. At this point I don't know what's the difference between a function and a macro.
